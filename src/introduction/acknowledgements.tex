\section*{\centering Acknowledgements}
\noindent
I would like to thank my supervisor, Jamie Willis, for his support throughout not only this project but also my time at Imperial.
Thank you for always being available no matter what time of day, and for introducing me to Scala and parser combinators in the first place.
\newline

\noindent
I would also like to thank my friends for making life interesting, and especially thank those who had to read my drafts and listen to my nonsensical ramblings about this project.
\newline

\noindent
Finally, I'd like to thank my family for their unwavering and unconditional support throughout my life.

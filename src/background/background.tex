\ourchapter{Background}\label{sec:background}
This \namecref{sec:background} covers the basic knowledge required to understand this project's two main areas of focus:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Linters} and the types of issues that they detect (\cref{sec:background-linters}), and how the \texttt{parsley-garnish} linter can be implemented as a Scala metaprogram that manipulates abstract syntax trees (\cref{sec:writing-scala-linters}).
  \item \textbf{Parser combinators}, their design patterns, and the \texttt{parsley} library (\cref{sec:background-parsers}).
\end{itemize}
%
Basic familiarity with Scala is assumed, although the code examples will be comprehensible for those experienced with a \textsc{jvm} language like Java or Kotlin.
Some experience with functional programming concepts is also beneficial, but not essential.

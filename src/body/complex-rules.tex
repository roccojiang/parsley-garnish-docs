\section{Simplify Parser}
\TODO{
* Catch cases when user manually writes out a parser that is already defined in the library
* Apply parser laws, re-using Parser and Func representations to do cool things
prettify = resugar . normaliseFunctions . simplify
}

\section{Convert to Parser Bridge}
\TODO{
* This would be cool, idk if I have time though, but this should also piggyback off of Func
* the pos bridges don't actually exist, so we can ignore that case and just say its too much code synthesis
* shouldn't be too bad? idk
* indicate limitations that this will only work if the ADT is defined in the same file, in order to extend it
